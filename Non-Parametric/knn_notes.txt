Using cosine distance (1 - x*y/(|x||y|)):
Accuracies from k = 1-10:
[0.78,0.75,0.78,0.78,0.77,0.77,0.77,0.77,0.77,0.77]
Cosine distance is implemented by normalizing the data points and using Euclidean distance (these are equivalent).

Using Euclidean distance (|x-y|):
Accuracies from k = 1-10:
[0.77,0.74,0.77,0.77,0.78,0.78,0.78,0.77,0.78,0.77]

There is a slight dip at k = 2 for both distance metrics.
